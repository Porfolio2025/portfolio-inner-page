      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        From a very young age, I have been curious about how things work. This naturally led me to
        become obsessed with everything related to computers.

        I started programming more seriously in high school, initially learning how to do web
        scraping and interact with websites. Later, I dedicated myself to many exciting projects
        such as developing a bot for the Discord platform. I have worked on many projects, including
        chatbots, various web projects, applications, and more.
